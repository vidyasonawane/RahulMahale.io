My session was focused on

Introduction to Raspbian — I started with an introduction about the Raspberry Pi board, how it differs from other boards and some of its use cases. Then I talked about Raspbian, a port of Debian to the Raspberry Pi, which is also the recommended operating system for the Raspberry Pi. I showed how to get Raspbian setup and then showed how to setup this Raspberry Pi as a WiFi router. There was a short Q&A session which I answered to best of my knowledge my presentation and how to is available at my Github profile[1]
