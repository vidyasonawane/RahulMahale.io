__Workshop at MMCOE Pune__

A Fedora Workshop was conducted at Marathwada Mitramandal College of Engineering at Karve nagar Pune.[1] Maharashtra India on 31st August 2013. The participants were from the Department of Computer Engineering and Information Technology engineering students.

The workshop was divided into 3 different sessions.

I began the 1st session with the short open-source inspirational video[2].

__Session 1__

Session 1 was the Introduction to open-source and GNU/Linux. Through this session, I explained the term open-source by starting from the history of Unix, how the Free Software Foundation was found, How GNU works and explained the GPL licensing term. Then I introduced the Linux Kernel, how it is developed, how community works and the release schedules of the Kernel. Then I introduced the Fedora Linux distribution and told them how the Fedora community works and how to contribute to the Fedora project. Then I introduced the various open-source tools and applications which are alternative to other proprietary software.


__Session 2__

Session 2 was on Linux basic commands. I started this session with the overview of Linux file system and explained the linux filesystem hierarchy and use and purpose of directories like _/boot,/etc,/var_ etc. Then I demonstrated the use of some basic commands like _ls, ps, top, mkdir, pwd, man, etc_. Some user commands like _su, sudo useradd, mount, unmount etc_. This session introduced the students to the Linux basic use and operations. Some students had a laptop with pre-installed Linux distro and they also practised all these.

__Session 3__

Session 3 was the Bash scripting session, I began it with describing features and use of two powerful editors Vim and Emacs, I told them some text processing shortcuts and proceed towards the introduction of the Bash scripting. After Introducing the Bash scripting I highlighted the basics with practical examples on variables(local and global), loops(for, while, until), conditional statements(If, if/else) and switch case in the bash. After that, I gave one problem statement to write in bash for creating a menu driven program using the case to run different commands and applications. Few of them showed the good logic in their scripting and finally, I also demonstrated that program on the projector and showed the output.

After it, there was a short Q&A Session and I answered best of my knowledge to students and Staff.

Then we ended the last session with the short Linux video[3].

This was the summary of a workshop conducted at MMCOE, Thanks to Computer Department HOD Prof.Joshi Sir and staff members Prof. Rahul Dagade Sir and Shailaija Madam for arranging the workshop and maintaining such wonderful hospitality.
